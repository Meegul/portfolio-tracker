# Portfolio Tracker
Will eventually be a realtime-ish tracker for your portfolio. Because refreshing a page to see how much money you've made/lost is _so_ 2010.

# Instructions to Use
1. You need to be on a recent browser (sorry Netscape Navigator, I'm not going to support you).
2. Get an API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/).
3. Get a valid ticker. See [Alpha Vantage's documentation](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#latestprice) on what constitutes a valid ticker. 
4. Insert values from 2 and 3 into the configuration section of the `index.html` file. Do a Ctrl-F for `// CONFIG SECTION HERE` if you can't find it.
